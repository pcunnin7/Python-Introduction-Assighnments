def numVowelsInFile(fileName):
    """
        The function has variables for each vowel, with both the vowel in uppercase and
        lowercase. Each vowel has a count variable starting at 0. 'Try' is used to cover errors later.
        The function opens whatever file is used as the fileName parameter. The function loops through
        each line of the file and loops through each character in the line and checks if it is a vowel.
        If it is, the corresponding count goes up by 1. The function then prints each count. If a
        FileNotFoundError, NameError, or IOError occurs where the entered file name does not exist or
        is incorrect, the program prints 'Invalid file name'.
